            <h2>Callbacks</h2>
            <p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.<br>
                In order to make things line up the way you like you could:<br>
                Order the functions in the right order, but one might not finish before the other.<br>
                Call a function at the end of another function, but you might want different functions called at any one time.<br>
                Now callbacks come in, you can provide a function as an input parameter that the function can call, allowing for the initial function call to provide the necessary function.      
            </p>
            <pre>myFunction(param1, param2, myCallBack);</pre>
            <p>Good example was when the <b>myCallBack</b> might want to output the reply to console, or screen, or various widgets etc.</p>
