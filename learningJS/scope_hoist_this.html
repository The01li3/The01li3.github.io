            <h1>Scope, Hoisting & this Keyword</h1>
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>Global, Block or Function scopes.<br>
                Both const and let are block scoped, var is not block scoped, but try not to use.<br>
                Assigning a value to a variable that has not been declared automatically makes that variable global.<br>
                Variables start when declared, and close either in their block, their function, or when global when the tab is closed.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Hoisting</h2>
            <p>Variables can be declared after they have been used because of hoisting.<br>
                All declarations get moved to the top of the scope in which they have been created.<br>
                If assigned at declaring, the assigning doesn't also get moved.
            </p>
            <p>Let and const get hoisted, but not initialized. Honestly just hoist them yourself, it makes code more readable.</p>
            <p>For the most part, ignore JS's behaviour here and declare variables at the top, its just better</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>this</h2>
            <p>this, refers to an object, you cannot change the value of this, it a keyword.</p>
            <h3>Object Method</h3>
            <p>Refers to the objects values.</p>
            <pre>const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    id: 5566,
    fullName : function() {
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName; //person.firstName...
    }
};
</pre>
            <h3>Alone</h3>
            <p>Alone, this refers to the global object.</p>
            <pre>let x = this; //[object Window]</pre>
            <h3>Function</h3>
            <p>In a non strict function, this refers to the global object.</p>
            <pre>function myFunction() {
    return this;
}</pre>
            <h3>Event Handlers</h3>
            <p>In HTML event handlers, this refers to the HTML element that received the event:</p>
            <pre>&ltbutton id="btn-properties-eg" type="button" class="btn btn-show" onclick='fnShowHide(this,"properties-eg")' &gtShow # Property Examples&lt/button%gt</pre>
            <h3>Call and Apply</h3>
            <p>Both allow you to call a function using different parameters.<br>
                Call is comma, Apply is an array.<br>
                The difference is that apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array; call requires the parameters be listed explicitly.
            </p> 
            <pre>function Product(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
}

function Food(name, price) {
    Product.call(this, name, price);
    this.category = 'food';
}

console.log(new Food('cheese', 5).name); // Expected output: "cheese"</pre>
            <pre>const numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];
const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);</pre>
