            <h1>Errors, Debugging, Best Practice</h1>
            <h2>Errors</h2>
            <p>Can use a <b>try... catch...</b> finally block.<br>
                <b>try</b> will run the code inside it.<br>
                <b>catch</b> will run if the try fails with either a system error message or a <b>throw</b> message.<br>
                <b>finally</b> gets run regardless of the try/catch result.
            </p>
            <p>In <b>catch(e)</b> the e is the error object, it consists of a name, and a message, display it, console.log it, whatever, its fairly useful to see what went wrong.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>F12 really helpful, can use it to break at certain points, then do a step-over to see whats causing the error.<br>
                <b>Console.log()</b> will also likely get used a lot to see certain variables, and what XYZ happens.<br>
                There's also a <b>debugger;</b> command, that acts the same way as putting in a break point in the debugger.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Strict</h2>
            <p><b>"use strict;</b> will make the code run in strict mode.<br>
                It can also be used inside a function for block scoping.<br>
                Only works if at the begging of the script or function.<br>
                Makes it so that the code is less lenient on bad syntax, need to declare variables, less likely to mistype a variable, cannot delete a variable etc.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Styling</h2>
            <p>Normally use Hungarian notation in camelCase:<br>
                vVariable, bBool, cCount, arrArray... etc.<br>
                Apart from global variables that are often full caps, with an underscore <b>INVOICETYPE_INVOICE</b><br>
                css and html classes with hyphens <b>btn-primary-eg</b>
            </p>
            <p>Spaces tend to appear around operators <b>1 + 1 = 2</b> and after commas <b>name = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]</b></p>
            <p>W3Schools says to use 2 spaces instead of tabs based off the fact editors can interpret tabs differently... I've always just used tabs.</p>
            <p>Use lowercase file names, servers can look at them different so consistent is lowercase.</p>
            <h2>Best Practice</h2>
            <p>Try to avoid using global variables.<br>
                Declare variables, preferably as high up as possible.<br>
                Initialise variables where possible, helps recognise what the variable type is.<br>
                Objects and arrays declared with <b>const</b>.<br>
                Dont use <b>new Object();</b> just declare them as empty "", 0, [], {}... etc.<br>
                === where possible, saves something like <b>0=="" OR 1==true //true</b> and leading to complications.<br>
                Function undefined variables can break it, can assign default values: <b>myFunction(a=1, b=1){}</b> to fill in if the variable is undefined.<br>
                Switches end with defaults in case there's a case statement missing for XYZ value.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
            <p>== is comparison = is assign. <b>if (x = 10)</b> will be true.<br>
                Switch statements use ===.<br>
                + ... can be strings or numbers.<br>
                floats are odd 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004.<br>
                \ to break up js string variables.<br>
                Undefined is not null.<br>
                JS starts at 0.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>Try to avoid assign statements in a for loop to make the loop faster:</p>
            <pre>let l = arr.length;
for (let i = 0; i &lt l; i++) {}</pre>
            <p>Searching for HTML can also be slow so the below is better:</p>
            <pre>const obj = document.getElementById("demo");
obj.innerHTML = "Hello";</pre>
            <p>However adversely, don't create variable when you can get away without</p>
            <pre>let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = fullName;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = firstName + " " + lastName;</pre>
            <hr>
            <h2>Reserved Words</h2>
            <p>Some words you cannot use, use Hungarian notation and you'll be fine.</p>
